r"""Audio sync measurement module.

This module is able to analyze two WAV files coming from a simultaneous
recording and calculate the latency of these two signals. These 2 signals
must have one peak every period and low volume noise or silence between
the peaks. See README.md for a description of how the algorithm works.
